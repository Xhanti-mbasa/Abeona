Run rmyndharis/OpenWA on a computer/server you control, or use a gateway you trust. The server processes messages from its linked account, so WhatsApp updates are not entirely phone-local.") }

Put it behind HTTPS with a valid certificate, using your host's reverse proxy/domain setup. Your phone needs that HTTPS address, for example https://wa.your-domain/api. localhost on your phone means the phone, not your server. Abeona cannot provision hosting or a certificate for you.") }

Use Sessions to create and start an account, then link it using WhatsApp → Linked devices and the dashboard QR code or pairing flow. For reading channels, set ENGINE_TYPE=whatsapp-web.js on the gateway. Baileys does not support the channel history endpoint used here. A dedicated account is useful. The linked account must belong to the group or follow the channel you want to read.") }

Add allowedChats restrictions for the exact groups/channels you want when supported by your installed version. Copy the new key when shown; keep your admin key out of this app. If the server administrator manages keys, ask them for a restricted Reader key and HTTPS address.") }

It is not your phone number, the account name, a group ID or a channel invite link. The app's Find linked accounts button retrieves the accounts visible to your Reader key, so you normally do not need to copy this UUID.") }

Enter the HTTPS gateway website and Reader key, tap Find linked accounts, choose the ready account and tap Test & connect reader. We add /api if you entered only a website origin; a supplied custom path is kept. If listing accounts is unavailable, choose Enter account ID manually and paste its UUID. Credentials are encrypted on this installation and excluded from profile backups.") }

Verify the publisher yourself; a name alone does not prove official identity. For a group, use the exact @g.us ID shown by your gateway. For a channel, use its @newsletter ID; a whatsapp.com/channel invitation code is different. Your chosen service tag does not change a feed's authority.") }
            item { HelpStep("If something fails","401/403: check key expiry and account/feed permissions. 404: check /api and the UUID. 409 or an account that is not ready: start it and finish linking in the dashboard. 501: channel reading needs whatsapp-web.js. A blank list can mean this account follows no channels or this key cannot see them. Connection failure: check HTTPS certificate, network and gateway availability. Dated saved posts remain readable; official schedules keep working independently.") }
            item { HelpStep("Pausing and removing access","Pause reader stops app checks. Disconnect & erase inbox removes this phone's saved credentials and posts. Revoke the key or unlink the linked device in WhatsApp/OpenWA to remove server access too. Optional background checks run about every 15 minutes; they are not instant alerts. OpenWA is unofficial and changes in WhatsApp may break this alpha feature.") }
