# Abeona

**Predominantly built with AI**

Abeona is the next version of the existing CTTrains Android transport app. This branch contains the recovered app and backend plus initial stabilisation. The full redesign and final monorepo structure await visual selection. No Google Play readiness is claimed.

See [inspection and blockers](docs/production/inspection-2026-10-12.md), [provider inventory](docs/production/provider-inventory.md), and [monorepo and release plan](docs/production/monorepo-and-release-plan.md).

An unofficial REST API and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Cape Town Metrorail train schedules and service updates. Data is scraped live from [cttrains.co.za](https://cttrains.co.za).

## Android app

The [`apps/android/`](apps/android/README.md) directory contains a native **Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Google Material 3** transit app: online and downloadable offline MapLibre/OpenFreeMap maps without Google keys or login, full-screen maps with mapped rail traces and numbered transfer/platform details, native CT Trains alerts, journey planning, local fare corrections and budget totals, favourites, saved leave-by plans with custom backup reminders, service tools and user-reviewed calendar export. Private content uses encrypted local Room storage. It works with direct CT Trains access or the normalized `/mobile/v1` backend. Open `apps/android/` in Android Studio. See the [setup and limits](apps/android/README.md) and [staged architecture](apps/android/docs/TRANSIT_ARCHITECTURE.md).

The **Android build and release** GitHub Action tests, lints and builds both APK variants. Publishing a verified APK and checksum to GitHub Releases now requires an explicit manual run with `publish_github_release` enabled. Development-signed builds are labelled prereleases; optional private signing secrets support production releases. See the [release instructions](apps/android/README.md#github-releases).

## ⚡ Quick Start (Automated Setup)

The easiest way to get the server running on any Linux machine (Arch, CachyOS, Ubuntu, Debian) is using the automated setup script. It will install all requirements (Node, Redis, Docker), start the necessary services, and launch the API for you!

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Xhanti-mbasa/cttrains-api.git
cd cttrains-api
./setup.sh
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup (Manual)

If you prefer to run it manually using Docker (recommended for production servers as it includes the Redis cache automatically):

1. **Copy environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. **Start the containers in the background:**
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. **Check the logs:**
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose logs -f
   ```

---

## 💻 Native Setup (Manual)

To run the API directly on your host machine without Docker:

1. **Install requirements:** Ensure you have Node.js and Redis installed.
   - Arch/CachyOS: `sudo pacman -S nodejs npm redis`
   - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install nodejs npm redis-server`
2. **Enable Redis:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now redis
   ```
3. **Install project dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🤖 AI / MCP Integration (Gemini, Claude, etc.)

This repository comes with native **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** support, allowing AI agents to look up train schedules directly!

### Connect your AI via Stdio Transport
You can connect an MCP-compatible AI client (like Claude Desktop) to the `services/api/src/mcp-server.js` script. Add this to your AI client's configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cttrains": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/cttrains-api/src/mcp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```
*(If your API is running on a remote server like Tailscale, you can change the command to `ssh` and pass the server IP!)*

### Terminal Chat with Gemini
If you want to test the MCP server using Gemini right now in your terminal:
1. Add your Gemini API key to `.env` (`GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`).
2. Run the included bridge script:
   ```bash
   node src/gemini-client.js
   ```
3. Ask it questions like: *"When is the next train from Bellville to Cape Town?"*

## 📖 API Documentation
Once the server is running (default port `3000`), visit `http://localhost:3000/` or `http://<your-server-ip>:3000/` in your browser to see the full list of available REST endpoints.
